//Issues
- add gstreamer-plugin-good and gstreamer-plugin-alsa as dependency

//refactor squeezeclient-bin
- connect InternalVolumeControlEnabled

//Extended testing
- fully test sync play use case (next / stop / pause / ...)
- test other formats

//packageing
- make a shared lib from currently static one
- create debianization
- check if header files are packaged correctly ...

//compile configure option to exclude gst player
  * add configure option
  * ifdef out as pre configure option


//generic open topics
- fill attributes of STAT with meaningful values
- WLAN channels
  * read out from linux and transfer
  * or configure
- Country code
  * option to read out?
  * or configure or set statically?
- check in squeezelite what STATu does. When is it called
	-> Signals Underrun ... Let's ignore first ...
